# Filters for a minimal web experience

I usually visit websites for a specific reason, but most of them are baked with unnecessary stuff that I don't even care about. So I created these filters to limit them to the specific purposes I think they should serve.

As a side note, these filters are personal and opinionated, so if you're going to use them, feel free to adapt them to your own specific needs.

# How to use

For uBlock Origin, go to the Filter Lists pane under Extension Settings, add the URL of the filter list in the Import... section and click Apply Changes.

# Purpose

## GitHub

I want to use GitHub for collaborative software development. So I got rid of distractions like Feeds and Explore, social media features like Star and Follow, and gamification elements like Achievements and Highlights.
