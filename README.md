# Filters for a minimal web experience

I usually visit websites for a specific reason, but most of them are baked with unnecessary stuff that I don't even care about. So I created these filters to limit them to the specific purposes I think they should serve.

As a side note, these filters are personal and opinionated, so if you're going to use them, feel free to adapt them to your own specific needs.

# How to use

For uBlock Origin, go to the Filter Lists pane under Extension Settings, add the URL of the filter list in the Import... section and click Apply Changes.

# Purpose

## GitHub

I want to use GitHub for collaborative software development. So I got rid of distractions like Feeds and Explore, social media features like Star and Follow, and gamification elements like Achievements and Highlights.

## Letterboxd

I want to use Letterboxd to find films to watch, so only films and lists are kept. The film page only shows film details, where to watch, ratings, related movies, and related lists. And the list page only shows films and additional information. Also, the home page is simplified to show only the featured films, while the popular films and lists are on their own pages.

**Note:** I don't have an account on Letterboxd because I don't need one for my purpose. So I am not sure how this filter list works when someone is logged in.

## YouTube

I want to use YouTube to watch videos that I find online or to search for videos related to the topic at hand, so recommendations, feedback (likes and comments), subscriptions and other random distractions are removed. Also, I usually use YouTube without an account, so I removed the features that require an account, like download and save.
