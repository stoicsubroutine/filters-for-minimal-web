# Filters for a minimal web experience

I usually visit websites for a specific reason, but most of them are baked with unnecessary stuff that I don't even care about. So I created these filters to limit them to the specific purposes I think they should serve.

As a side note, these filters are personal and opinionated, so if you're going to use them, feel free to adapt them to your own specific needs.
